    <p>Hi, I'm Kate! As a UX/UI designer, I specialize in creating intuitive and visually compelling digital experiences. With a background in both software and video game design, I bring a unique perspective to every project. My approach combines thorough user research with creative problem-solving to build interfaces that are not just beautiful, but truly user-centric. I believe in designing experiences that feel effortless and natural, where every interaction is meaningful and every detail serves a purpose. Let's collaborate to create something exceptional!</p>
