    <h1>Steam Spy</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://steamspy.com/">Steamspy.com</a> is a website that shows how many people own or play a particular game. It has stats on total playtime, total owners, youtube viewers and twitch streamers. Steam Spy can be used by regular players to
      find a recently released popular games. This site is also very useful for game developers, because they can estimate how much money a game has made as well as find out how popular a particular genre is. They can also use this site to compare games
      against each other.
    </p>

    <h1>GOALS</h1>
    <p>
     I&apos;m going to redesign the Steam Spy website by using google material design. And I want to simplify navigation system and improve game filters.

    <h1>WEB</h1>
    <p>Steam Spy has a huge library of games. Its the full steam catalog 8000 games.</p>

      <source src="video/web1.mp4" type="video/mp4">

    <p>Many filters and sorts help users to find exactly what they are looking for.</p>

    <h1>REDESIGN THOUGHTS</h1>

    <p>
      In the original site the filters are hard to understand. You couldn't filter by a year range, total players or total sales. I replaced this with filter where you can drag both start and end of the range.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many game developers use Steam Spy to guess at the money the game has made. The formula is pretty simple number of owners * the price of the game. Steam takes about 30% and game developers keep 70%. This is pretty important use of the site. But this is totally lacking on Steam Spy itself. In my redesign I put the estimated game earnings front and center, enabling people to view it and search for it in filters.

    <p>
      Default view for steam spy is a list of games. I think that it works only for game developers, but not for players. Because players would like to see beautiful posters of the game and bigger pictures. That's why I created the gallery and the list views for users to pick which one they prefer.
